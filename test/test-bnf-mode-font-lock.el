;;; Commentary:

;; Define test-suites to test `bnf-mode' font locking using `buttercup'.

;;; Code:

(require 'buttercup)

(when (require 'undercover nil t)
  ;; Track coverage, but don't send to coverage serivice.  Save in parent
  ;; directory as undercover saves paths relative to the repository root.
  (undercover "*.el" "test/utils.el"

              (:send-report nil)))
